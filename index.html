      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Canadian production manager for National Oilwell Varco in the Fiberglass Systems department. After highschool I developed a background in architecture.  I am also currntly enrolled in an online BBa program at Yorkville University. 
         I am hoping to gain the ability to reverse engineer computer languages in order to solve low to high level business problems, automate administrative tasks, 
        manage data bases and construct warehouses, netSEC and penetration testing (one day) and most importantly develop whatever software I desire or need to sell. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Toronto, Ontario</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I haev a lot of hobbies as I like to keep busy and don't really like sleeping too much.  During any given day you can usually find me playing my cello, practicing Muay Thai, 
        reading comics (spawn is the ultimate hero), partaking in twilight/night photography or working on watches that I enjoy tinkering with.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be to manage my own technology driven business from a remote location.  I enjoy collaborating briefly but enjoy working alone when focused on tasks. Given my business background I have always also thought of creating a realestate holding company if I ever had the capital.  I think the two might contrast very well!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In a very cold basement in Toronto</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I think web development is the best place to start for a person like me who is ambitious and has a lot of floating ideas passing through his head.  Having this actionable skill will likely help me test some of these ideas at a low cost and then decide if they are worth my time or not.  I have also seen that this skill set is in high demand and that gives me peace of mind as it is good to know if none of my ideas work I can at least go get employed to build someone elses!</p>
